## Course Overview
- In this course, you'll use IBM Watson Studio to build classification models to predict (identify) animal sounds and use IBM Watson Visual Recognition to identify images of those animals
- You'll learn how best to gather and prepare data, create and deploy models, deploy and test a signal processing application, create models with binary and multiclass classifications, and display the predictions on a web page that you create by using Node-RED
- When you finish this course, you should know how to:
    - Prepare data so that it can be consumed by machine learning models
    - Build a binary classification model that can predict which animal (dogs and cats) is making a specific sound
    - Build a multiclass classification model to detect whether a birdsong is from a bird from a specific order and view the confidence level of that prediction
    - Make predictions on audio files by using a Node-RED application built as a web page
    - Create an application in Node-RED that integrates the Watson Visual Recognition service with your machine learning model to recognize images of cats and dogs
